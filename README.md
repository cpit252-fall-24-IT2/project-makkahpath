(Makkah Path) 
project description: 
This app aims to improve transportation for both Umrah performers and visitors to 
Makkah. By incorporating a bus reservation system and QR code technology, we ensure that 
transportation is safer, more comfortable, and more convenient. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance 
the experience for all users, allowing them to focus on their spiritual journey or visit to the Holy 
Mosque without worrying about transportation challenges.
